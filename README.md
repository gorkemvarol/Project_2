We will be creating a Web application that takes input parameters and uses them to select an effective study partner or create their own study group. Eg. student location, subject, time, desired cohort, and level of coursework. This information will be stored in a database and when new input is created, relevant students (those with similar needs) will be shown to the user. 

We will be using a made up dataset of students seeking to study with partners or with groups, and forms will be added to the dataset as they are created. The dataset will be coded by assigning random values that will be selectable in the form for each ‘student’, a random city with a population of over 100,000 will be assigned for the location. E.g. student number x’s form will be:
Location: Madison-WI, Studying: Calculus 1, Time: Friday 12-4, phone number: 333-333-3333, Lat-Long: [-45,45], seeking: group study
